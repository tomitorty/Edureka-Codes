//1. JavaScript was created in 10 days- Brendan Eich developed it in 1995 while working at Netscape.
//2. JavaScript is not Java- Despite the similar name JavaScript and Java are entirely different.
//3. JavaScript is the most widely used programming language- JavaScript consistently ranks as the most popular larguage in developer surveys.
//4. JavaScript runs in the browser- it was initially designed to make webpages interactive.
//5. It is also used on the server-side- With the rise of Node.js JavaScript can now power backend applications.
//6. JavaScript is loosely typed- You don't need to specify data types for variables (e.g., let x =5;).
//7. It supports object-oriented programming- It allows the use of classes, objects, and prototypes.
//8. Asynchronous programming is a key feature- JavaScript uses callbacks, promises andy async/ await to handle asynchronous tasks.
